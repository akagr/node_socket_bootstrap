Node.js Socket.io Bootstrap App
=====================================

This is a simple bootstrap app containing most of the boilerplate node.js app. Feel free to fork and build your app on top of it.

All the branches are named as `e-x.y_s-a.b`. x.y is the express version and a.b is the socket version for that app. I plan to regularly update this repo with major syntax changes in versions of any of these two or any module which affects their syntax.
